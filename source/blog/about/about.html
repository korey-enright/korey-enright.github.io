### Korey Enright
#### Web and Software Developer, Gamer, and Writer

Hi! I'm a burgeoning developer based out of Chicago! I've been
learning Ruby on Rails, and am working on a web design project to
create a framework for a [role-playing game
online](https://github.com/stephmarx/arcadia-throne-war)! I am also
looking for new projects to do - as I am always interested in
expanding my knowledge. I currently work for Oracle as an analyst. I
am looking to branch out and learn more about front-end and back-end
development, and I hope to be building robust web apps soon!

Hello there! I'm a new-ish web developer who currently works at
Oracle. I am in the process of expanding my knowledge about web
development, and right now I am learning how to use Ruby on Rails! I
have a lot of experience working with algorithmic programming, but not
too much experience working with databases or in an official,
collaborative project. Fortunately, that all is changing right now!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Mistakes in Design</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve been looking for an android wearable recently, and I have
come across the Huawei Watch. It hasn&rsquo;t yet been released,
unfortunately, but it looks like it is going to rival, and perhaps
even exceed the Apple Watch when it is finally released. I was
interested in maybe getting the Moto 360 or the LG Watch, but I
dislike the little flat tire design on the Moto and the square design
of the LG. The Huawei&rsquo;s traditional watch design looks really
fantastic, and indeed, I really enjoy it. I much prefer it to some
other watches.</p>

<p>But, there is an issue with Huawei&rsquo;s design. Not so much in the watch,
which again is fantastic, but in the design for their
<a href="consumer.huawei.com/minisite/worldwide/huawei-watch/">website</a>. It
looks nice enough, a pleasant theme that works well, not too many
images beyond the massive info wall, and everything looks easily
navigable. That is, until you try to scroll down to read more
information. Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I prefer to scroll with
my mouse. Sure, I can use the keyboard, but I like keeping my hands
ready to type as opposed to over by the arrow keys. When you try to
scroll down with a scroll wheel on Huawei&rsquo;s site, like, you know,
normal human beings generally do, it treats each click of the wheel as
going down one &ldquo;frame&rdquo; in the infographic. This is absolutely awful,
and completely unlike anything else on the web. It&rsquo;s infuriating,
actually. Like, who could have possibly thought that would have been a
good idea?</p>

<h2>Complete Segue into the Project I Am Now Working On</h2>

<p>First things first: screw the everloving shit out of corporate
firewalls. They make everything stupid difficult to deal
with. Anyways, dealing with a corporate firewall on Windows actually
isn&rsquo;t too bad for most things - for instance, to fix like everything
on a Windows system you have to figure out what your proxy server is,
and then you can throw that info into the System Environment variables
on your system by making a new variable: <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> with the value
being proxy.address:port. The problem is that this doesn&rsquo;t fix every
problem. Sure, you can use git now, and gem, and all the other super
useful commands, but not every rake command is going to work well.</p>

<p>Right now, we are building tests for our database. Now, normally
everything should work fine - we&rsquo;re using FFaker and Factory Girl to
generate data for RSpec test cases. Unfortunately, when I try to run
<code>rake test</code>, things get wonky. Specifically, it can&rsquo;t figure out how
to setup a local server (or something) and run the tests there. Oh
well. I guess one day I&rsquo;ll figure it out, and what&rsquo;s more, TravisCI
runs the tests, so everything at the very least seems to be working.</p>

<p>Man this blog is random. Eh, I&rsquo;ll get better at this in time, just
like I will at Ruby on Rails!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Codecamp</h3>

<p>This is my first experiment in blogging, and a lot of things have changed recently. First and
formost, my confidence regarding coding has increased! I realize that I&rsquo;m not alone in where I am
(as silly as that sounds) and that while I can&rsquo;t recite documentation and don&rsquo;t really know
terminology, I have a reasonable understanding of concepts and can, with a bit of work, apply those
concepts.</p>

<p>This past weekend, among other things, I ended up going to a developer&rsquo;s conference with
my friend. While most of the conference was informative and fun, there were some aspects that
neither of us enjoyed. The first talk we went to was supposed to be a short lecture about software
development using strategy games as an analogy. We both like strategy games, and we both like
software development, so we decided to go. Things started off innocently enough - the slides weren&rsquo;t
great, and the lecturer seemed sort of arrogant, but then things took a hard right to privileged
asshole land.</p>

<p>He was discussing the concept of how software development involves limited manpower and how you want
to help train your developers to be the best they could be. This is a great idea, of course - you
always want to help your employees become better at their job, offering them the time and resources
to learn more about their craft. But he didn&rsquo;t mean it quite like that. The exact point where things
turned bad started like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>So you want to tell your recruiter that you only want A developers, because you
  only want star developers. Anyone who isn&rsquo;t a star developer isn&rsquo;t worth your time and money,
  because B developers will ruin everything you do and take too long to do anything.</p></blockquote>

<p>My friend and I turned to each other and made a face not unlike we had just eaten a
lemon. Whole. Rind and all. I asked if he realized that purchasing the top 1% of all software
developers was a little unrealistic, and my friend asked if he realized that learning is an
iterative process and that, maybe, just maybe, the people who &ldquo;just get it&rdquo; had different
experiences in their lives which exposed them to programming earlier and let them get further along
in the learning process than some other developers. The lecturer responded with &ldquo;I have 20 years of
experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, twenty years of coding experience totally equips you to understand the concepts
behind learning and intelligence, because as a coder you automatically know how everything in the
world works. Other people who studied human beings, like psychologists and I/O psychologists? Their
work is meaningless next to the vast, throbbing white male programmer&rsquo;s <del>ego</del> mind. Things never
really recovered from there, with the lecturer losing control over the conversation as a handful of
people disagreed with some of his more absurd premises and a handful agreed. All throughout, he
maintained that there are some people who &ldquo;just get it,&rdquo; because psychology is obviously wrong. His
views on the hiring process were equally unconscionable, but then, what can you do?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the entire rest of the conference was fantastic.</p>

<h4>SASS and Bourbon</h4>

<p>There was a wonderful talk about SASS (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) which gave a brief
overview of what SASS is (tl;dr: if fixes all of CSS&rsquo;s problems - allows you to nest styles and use
variables). But the meat of the talk was about <a href="https://bourbon.io">Bourbon</a>, a mixin library for
SASS. It essentially creates variables and methods that you can use with SASS out of the box, making
it much easier and faster to style you website. But that&rsquo;s not all - Bourbon also comes with a
framework, called <a href="https://neat.bourbon.io">Bourbon served Neat</a>. Neat is essentially a framework
designed around Bourbon, that is considerably cleaner and more efficient than other frameworks (like
Bootstrap). It has simple, semantic language, and is easy and convenient to use.</p>

<p>There are two more pieces to Bourbon that were talked about and demonstrated -
<a href="bitters.bourbon.io">Bitters</a> and <a href="refills.bourbon.io">Refills</a>. These are both extremely useful -
Bitters provides a scaffolding of existing styling and CSS resources to use, and Refills provides a
community maintained library of extremely useful CSS styling elements which lets you do customize a
website basically any way you want.</p>

<p>What was really nice about this talk, was that the speaker was polite, funny, and charismatic - he
knew how to discuss the concepts he was presenting, and he didn&rsquo;t go into the talk with an arrogant
preconvceived notion about how programming should or shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

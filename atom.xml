    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>CodinGame</h2>

<p>So I found CodinGame off of an advertisement on Facebook - its pretty nice. Its mostly just a bunch of various coding challenges centered around computer science principles coupled with gamification, but gamification does work. The feel of everything is right as well - the design is functional and easy to use, and the onboarding process is done very well. It guides you through using the browser-based IDE and the first of many challenges, effectively teaching you the basics of its interface.</p>

<p>On the other hand, trying to find friends and followers is a bit of a pain - there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for iconography as a navigational choice, but not all of it is kind. Particularly if the iconography is new or different when compared to similar websites. For instance, the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; button doesn&rsquo;t bring you to where you would expect - it brings you to what appears to be a page to sign up for a contest. In order to get to some sort of dashboard, you have to click on your profile, where you can find an overview of your activity on the site.</p>

<p>Of course, there is the question of what they want to drive traffic to (which is presumably the contests) but regardless, home should bring you to a section of the site where things are familiar and you feel like you are in control. This just brings you to a sign-up page for a very specific feature on the site.</p>

<h2>CodePen</h2>

<p>CodePen is a pretty amazing website - the UI is great, the design is both usable and beautiful, and the onboarding process was done quite well. It is essentially a public code repository, which is amazingly useful for pretty much anything, including showcasing your own work. I can see that I will learn quite a lot by using CodePen as a fun environment to test out new designs and concepts.</p>
